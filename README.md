This repository contains the code for the study **Law as Living Organisms**, where we explore U.S. case law data using network models to analyze the dynamics and evolution of judicial precedents. The study draws a parallel between the legal system and a living organism, analyzing decision networks and bibliographic coupling to understand patterns in legal cases over time.
